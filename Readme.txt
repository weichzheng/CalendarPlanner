Weichao Zheng - Personal Project - Daily Planner Application

This is a personal project I started over this past winter break (December 2019).
My motivation for creating this application was that I couldn't find a free planner
that was to my liking, and I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn
JavaScript and other programming tools popular in web development.

Features are still to be added, so some code that serves
no purpose yet is commented out.
